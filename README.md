# delta-t180

## Mission
This is my **6-month no-compromise sprint** towards elite systems engineering, algorithmic development, and deep computational problem-solving.

### Daily Streaks:
- Codeforces: 180-day streak
- Mathematics: 180-day streak
- Project Euler: 900 problems
- Physical Training: 180-day streak

### Major Targets:
- Kaggle Grandmaster by December 2025
- Weekly CTF participation
- Three hardcore HFT-style systems projects

## Structure
- `math/` – Daily math log and notes
- `ctf/` – Weekly CTF tracking and writeups
- `kaggle/` – Kaggle competition progress
- `euler/` – Project Euler streak and solved problems
- `codeforces/` – Codeforces streak and contest logs
- `hft_projects/` – Hardcore systems projects
